I really like Sublime Text 2. 

Three years ago, before I got serious about development I would doodle joyfully between Espresso (still the ideal lightweight IDE for web designers in my book) and TextMate. The power of TextMate's shortcuts and macros fascinated me, but I was never disciplined enough to learn them fully. 

But TextMate being powerful and light, I stuck with it even while trekking through the mediocre to atrocious editors I was sometimes forced to used through Object-oriented programming classes at Full Sail: TextWrangler, Flash, Flash Builder (a.k.a Eclipse by Adobe&reg;&copy;&trade;), Eclipse (*shudder*). It felt like an island of peace, tranquility and productivity compared to those, and as I was getting closer to the Rails world I noted that a great proportion of Ruby/Rails developers used TextMate, which could be a great thing since developer interest in an editor often encourages the creation of plugins and other useful bundles.

Then I met the folks at [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com) and started hearing about this Vim thingie which was split 50/50 with TextMate on their team at the time. I had heard of Emacs before, in an infuriatingly reactionary post by a well known "free software" douchebag. Vim seemed hard, but it looked even more powerful than TextMate. Yet, as a designer at heart, its basic lack of GUI and text-based everything made me squeamish.

I eventually learned how to use Vim through MacVim and the fantastic "starter pack" assembled by Yehuda Katz &amp; Carl Lerche which I mention in my [Utility Belt](http://olivierlacan.com/tools). But despite three months of relatively lazy struggle to memorize all the [Vim shortcuts](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif)
